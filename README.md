**Prepared by:** Emma Butler  
**Date:** November 10, 2024  

## Executive Summary

This report is a project created as part of the Cybersecurity for Energy program. The incident, findings, and recommendations do not represent an actual event or organization.

On December 14, 2023, SmartMeter Co. experienced a high-severity phishing attack targeting key employees.

Sensitive data, including intellectual property, was potentially exfiltrated. 


### Contributing Factors:
1. Lack of **email filtering**.
2. Absence of **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**.
3. Insufficient **phishing awareness training**.

### Key Recommendation:
Implementing **MFA** is the top priority to mitigate credential compromise risks.
